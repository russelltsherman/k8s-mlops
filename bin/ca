# Open the Settings app and click Profile Downloaded near the top.
# Click Install in the top right, and then Install again on the Warning screen.
# Once installed, hit Close and go back to the main Settings page.
# Go to General > About.
# Scroll to the bottom and click on Certificate Trust Settings.
# Enable your root certificate under “ENABLE FULL TRUST FOR ROOT CERTIFICATES”.
